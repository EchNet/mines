<h3>Playing Minesweeper</h3>
The game board is a grid of squares.  At the start of the game, all of the
squares are covered.  Some of the squares contain hidden mines! 
<br><br>
<em>Your challenge
is to uncover all of the squares that do not contain mines, leaving all
of the mines covered.</em>
<br><br>
To uncover a square, click on it with the left mouse button.

<h3>Locating Mines</h3>
An uncovered square that does not contain a mine either contains a
number or is blank.  If the square contains a
number, it represents the number of adjacent squares that are mined.
There are eight adjacent positions: top, bottom, left, right, top left,
top right, bottom left, bottom right.
If the square is blank, there are no adjacent mines.  The game automatically
uncovers all of the adjacent positions in this case.
Use the numbers on the uncovered squares and a bit of
logic to detect the positions of the mines!

<h3>Marking Squares</h3>
When you locate a mine, click on it with the right mouse button to flag it.
(Mac users: <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/node/66" target="_new">read this</a>)
When you click on a covered square with the right mouse button, you
rotate its display through three states: clear, flagged and question-marked.
If you accidentally left-click a flagged square, the game does not uncover it!
The question mark has no special function and is there to use as you see fit.

<h3>Making the Grade</h3>
When you uncover the last unmined square,
the game is over and you win!
<br><br>
The ticking counter in the upper right corner of the board shows your playing 
time in seconds.  The object is to win the game in as little time as possible.
The lower the number in the upper right corner when you win, the better.

<h3>Clearing around squares:</h3>
If a square is uncovered, you may quickly uncover all unflagged adjacent
squares by clicking
<em>both the left and right mouse buttons on the square simultaneously.</em>
Use this valuable shortcut to reduce your time and improve your score.
Flag the squares that you know are mined.  When you believe that all
the mined squares adjacent to an uncovered square are flagged, 
clear the remaining squares in one stroke, rather than uncovering each 
one by one...
but beware - if you have flagged a square incorrectly,
you will uncover a mine!
</td>
<td>
<h3>Using the Mine Counter</h3>
The counter in the upper left corner of the board shows the number of squares
left to flag.  At the start of the game, the number equals the number of 
mines on the board.  The number is reduced by one whenever you flag a square.
Notice that the counter only counts flags; it does not tell you whether you
have correctly flagged mined squares!
<h3>
The First Click:
</h3>
The first square you uncover is never mined.  Use this knowledge to your
advantage!
